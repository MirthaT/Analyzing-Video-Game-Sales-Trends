## Approach:

To achieve the objectives, I employ a structured approach that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and statistical analysis. Python serves as the primary programming language, with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## Skills and Technologies:

This project showcases proficiency in:

Data preprocessing techniques for cleaning and transforming raw data.
Python programming for data manipulation and analysis.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
Statistical analysis methods, including hypothesis testing.
Visualization tools such as Matplotlib for creating informative charts and graphs.

## Conclusion:

By applying a systematic approach to analyzing video game sales trends, this project demonstrates the ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets. Through the utilization of various analytical techniques and programming skills, I aim to provide valuable insights that can inform decision-making processes in the gaming industry.
